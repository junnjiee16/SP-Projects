# SP Projects
A compliation of projects done during my enrolment in Singapore Polytechnic's Diploma in Applied AI and Analytics (DAAA) course.

## ST0502 Fundamentals of Programming
> Javascript, Node.js

My first ever programming project. Built a command prompt text-based application of a robust meal ordering system, from the ordering of the food to checkout and generating a order receipt. As I was new to programming, I learnt a lot about basic programming and its uses as well as touched on Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

<br>

## ST0501 Front-End Web Development
> HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Javascript

Built an interactive website around the theme "My Experience in Poly and My Career Prospect". Learnt how to use Bootstrap 4 to create a mobile-friendly website as well as incoporated Javascript Document Object Models (DOM).

<br>

## ST0503 Back-End Web Development
> Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL

Learnt how to build server side software using MySQL as the database and Express as the server. Then embarked on a full-stack web development project combining the skills I have gained from ST1501 to build an online shopping application with a working back-end.

## ST1510 Programming for Data Analytics
> Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Not pushed.

<br>

## ST1502 Data Visualization
> Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau
Not pushed.

<br>

## ST1501 Data Engineering
> SQL, MongoDB

Learnt how to design Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) Databases using ERD Diagrams as well as set-up databases using Microsoft T-SQL. Also learnt about Data Warehouses and the different types of schemas (Star, Snowflake) as well as the data cleaning and Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes. I also learnt about NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases learnt using a NoSQL database which is MongoDB.

Using the knowledge acquired, I embarked on 3 diferent projects in this module.
* ```VideoRentalsOLTP SQL```: Designed and set-up a OLTP Database with mock data and working business queries for a equipment rental company (fake scenario).
* ```Bikes MongoDB```: Set-up a MongoDB Database with mock data and working business queries for a bike rentals company (fake scenario).
* ```TrekDataWarehouse```: Worked with 2 other teammates to design and set-up a Data Warehouse for a bike rentals company (fake scenario). Did the data cleaning and ETL process on a OLTP Database given in the assignment. Link to the repository of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/JoelPoah/TrekDataWarehouse).
